* In this group project we'll work towards creating a travel advisory - like app.
* We came up with the problem: "We come to Florida for the amazing sunny weather, but then it rains ..... so what now?"
* Our app will be designed so a user can open it up and look for indoor activities to do if it's raining.
* But it doesn't stop there, we'll also provide the user with activities to do outside, when the weather is crystal clear.

* Hence the name Rain or Shine: Find a cool, entertaining activity to do whether it's raining or not! 

* Rain or Shine, don't let the weather ruin your trip!
